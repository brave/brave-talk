# Brave Talk

## Working with the code

The website is built using [webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org).

To work with it locally:

    $ npm install
    $ npm start

Source code is all in [`src`](./src). Contents of [`public`](./public) are deployed to target without further modification.

Before you commit, you most likely want to ensure the continuous integration build will not
fail. To run the most likely-to-fail checks, use:

    $ npm run check

To build for production:

    $ npm ci
    $ npm run build

which creates a `./html` directory containing compiled assets.

# Branching Strategy

- `prod` => releases to [talk.brave.com](http://talk.brave.com) (production)
- `main` => releases to staging
- `dev` => releases to development

1. production releases should only be made after we have been able to test exactly what we're going to release on stage. So these should always be a PR from `main` to `prod` that's basically "make production === stage". These are the only PRs that should go to `prod`.
2. therefore a merge to `main` should only happen when we think the feature is ready to release.
3. when starting a piece of work, create a branch off `main` and keep adding commits there until it's ready to release.
4. to test the code in a real environment, either:
   a. merge that branch to `dev` - but don't delete the feature branch. Repeatedly merge the feature that feature branch to `dev` as work progresses. Merges to `dev` do not require PRs.
   OR
   b. manually initiate the "Deploy to Development" github action selecting that branch - this will deploy just those changes to development.
5. In-development QA of this feature should happen on the development environment.
6. when it's good to go merge the feature branch to `main` - with a PR and security review if required. Do not merge until all reviews are completed.
7. then, after checking on the staging environment (including QA regression testing if needed) PR a production release as per step 1.
8. now and again we will reset `dev` to match `main` just to keep the history tidy.

# `index.html` Updating Strategy

Japanese language support is available for brave-talk. So whenever we are adding new content in `index.html`, we have to make the following changes:

1. add `i18n-element-text` class to the new tag
2. add appropriate `id` to the new tag which is used as a key for translation
3. add the appropriate content translation in the `src > locales`. The format is {key: `tag id`, value: `transated version`}

# Prettier

This codebase uses [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to keep the code formatted nicely and avoid needless changes in diff. It's recommended
that you [configure your editor](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) to reformat as you go. There's also a pre-commit hook configured that should
reformat on commit, or you can run `npm run format`.
